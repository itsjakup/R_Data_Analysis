### 'Student Spendings' Project

**Description**:

The "Student Spendings" project investigates the spending habits of students to identify trends and factors affecting their financial choices. 
By collecting data on expenditures across various categories—such as tuition, housing, food, and entertainment—the project employs exploratory data analysis (EDA) to reveal patterns in student spending behavior.
Machine learning models are utilized to predict future spending trends based on demographic and lifestyle factors, providing insights that can help students and educational institutions make informed financial decisions. 
The project ultimately aims to enhance financial literacy and support better budgeting practices among students.
